"Origins" is a story of the individual, potentially convergent paths of two people making their way through Pittsburgh. There are two available modes, a "myopic" view wherein the player controls a single character's choices (but the consequences of both characters' actions are still shown); and "omniscient", where both character's choices are available. The story is rendered in multi-pane hypertext.
