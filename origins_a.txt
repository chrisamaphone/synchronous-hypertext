The exhaust from the 67 bus is hot against your side while you're standing at
a red light for Beechwood Boulevard, and you wonder why you even took this
route.

The light for Beechwood turned yellow, and cross-traffic is about to stop.

(a_0) Anticipate your green light and blow through the moment you have a gap.
(a_1) Wait for the 67 to get ahead of you before you fall in behind it.

a_0

You drive down into the pedals and peel out into the intersection before the
bus has a chance to get rolling. Wilkins Avenue is uphill for the next block,
but you can't stand eating exhaust anymore.

The raindrops grow fatter and break against your goggles.

(a_00) Squint between the drops and keep moving.
(a_01) Give them a quick wipe.

---
a_1

The 67 starts moving with a roar, and you count to five before you click into
your pedals and start up Wilkins Avenue behind it.

Now the exhaust is hot and in your face.

(a_10) Swing a left onto Denniston Street to get out of the wake.
(a_11) Fall further back so you have breathing room.

---

a_00

You can still sort of see the road, but you're practically hitting every
pothole on the way to your package drop.

The rumbling of the 67 bears down on you.

(a_000) Pedal faster.
(a_001) Take your next left so you can catch a quick break.

---

a_01

You run the back of your glove over your goggles; the drops clear for a
moment, just in time for you to swerve around a pot hole.

There's a handful of cars waiting for the light at Shady Avenue.

(a_010) Cut left across the street and turn onto Denniston Street to avoid the
holdup.
(a_011) Slow to a stop and wait.

---

a_10

You suddenly take the side street, slipping through a gap between cars you
almost didn't see.

One of those cars honks and flips you off.

(a_100) Sprint down Denniston Street and hope you're not followed.
(a_101) Pull a handful of coins out of your pocket and fling them at the car.

---

a_11

As the bus pulls ahead, you can breathe easy again. You can't help but wonder
if you're going to make your drop on time, though.

Do you feel late?

(a_110) Yes.
(a_111) No.

---

a_000

As you sprint down the road, the handlebars vibrate against your palms, and
you are blinded by the rain dripping over your goggles.

A woman stands in the road ahead of you, holding something in her hand and
looking distraught.

(a_0000) Swerve around her.
(a_0001) Slow to a stop.

---

a_001

You swing a left turn at the light for Shady Avenue, ignoring the screech of
badly-adjusted brakes as a car narrowly avoids bashing into you. At least
there isn't a bus riding way too close to you anymore.

A dog trots at you from a side street.

(a_0010) It probably wants to say hi.
(a_0011) It's probably going to dive at your wheels.

---

a_0010

The dog keeps pace with you with a loping gait, its tongue hanging out of a
knowing grin. What do dogs even think they know, anyway? 

You've got a package to deliver, so you can't keep staring at it forever.

(00100) Give it a quick pat on the head and move on.
(00101) Order it to stay put so it doesn't get in your way.

---

a_0011

It's better to be cautiously pessimistic about these things, so you brace
yourself in case the dog tries something stupid. It doesn't, though; it just
slows down and stares at you with its head cocked in confusion.

a_010

The traffic's not worth sitting through, and you've got this package
weighing you down. It's a little out of the way, but you'd rather keep
moving. Moving is productive. Waiting is inefficient.

You beat the traffic, but up ahead, you see bright orange signs warning about
road work.

(a_0100) Those are just for cars.
(a_0101) Maybe you better reroute again.

---

a_011

You know that you're going to run into traffic whichever road you're on,
so you might as well stick to your route here.  

The light turns before long.

(a_0110) Looks like that wasn't too bad of a wait.
(a_0111) You're still impatient.

---

a_100

Whoever was annoyed at you wasn't annoyed enough to chase you, so you're in
the clear. It's a relief to not have a bus breathing down your neck, but now
you're off-course.

Up ahead, you see bright orange signs warning about road work.

(a_1000) Those are just for cars.
(a_1001) Maybe you better reroute again.

---

a_101

You've always had a short temper when it comes to traffic, and the clatter
of your pocket change against the back of the retreating car gives you a
sense of satisfaction. Serves them right.

Up ahead, you see bright orange signs warning about road work.

(a_1010) Those are just for cars.
(a_1011) Maybe you better reroute again.

---

a_110

You're feeling a little anxious that you're not going to make it in time, but what can you even do about it?  

(a_1100) Pedal on with conviction.
(a_1101) Pedal on with dread.

---

a_111

You've got plenty of time to get there, so don't sweat it. Nothing can come
of being in a rush.

As you take your time, you feel the weight of the package pulling on your
shoulder.

(a_1110) Shift it a little.
(a_1111) Leave it where it is.

---

a_1000

The barricade only covers the road, so you pop over the curb and roll
along down the sidewalk. Despite the road work signs, you can't see any
evidence that they're working today. 

This is probably a decent shortcut.

(10000) You'll use it again next time.
(10001) You'll save it for a rainy day.

---

a_1001

It's probably better if you don't get yourself stuck in an endless maze of
roadblocks, so you hang a right on Shady Avenue and wiggle your way back
towards Wilkins.

There goes any time you thought you'd save.

(10010) Maintain your optimism.
(10011) Worry.

You don't know what that woman is up to, but you narrowly manage to avoid
hitting her as you blow through the intersection. She's shouting something
at you, but her words are buried by the rain hitting your helmet.

(00000) Swing back around and see what's wrong.
(00001) Never mind.

---

a_0001

In her hand is a folded up dog leash, and the woman looks relieved as you
pull up next to her. She gestures down South Negley Avenue, as if she's
expecting you to turn.

(00010) Abandon your job and go look for her dog.
(00011) Shake your head in apology and pedal on.
