Your feet thud against the sidewalk, spraying a thin layer of puddle water
against your shins. Your socks are already drenched.

Northumberland Street is getting torn up for repairs on the next block; you
can see the orange 'ROAD CLOSED' signs ahead.

(z_0) But you figure the sidewalk is still clear.
(z_1) Forget it, just hang a right on South Negley Avenue.

---

z_0

You skirt around the barricades for the road and stay on the sidewalk. No one
calls out to stop you, so you just keep going.

Some gravel manages to work its way into your sock as you jog over the uneven
ground.

(z_00) It's not a big deal.
(z_01) That's really annoying.

---

z_1

You don't want to take your chances with the DPW today, even if it means a
spontaneous hill workout.

In fact, you can see the Snegley hill looming a block ahead of you.

(z_10) Actually, never mind; turn right on Wilkins Avenue instead.
(z_11) Tell your legs to shut up and sprint for it.

---

z_00

The worst that'll happen is a blister, and you know you can deal with those.
Your stride suffers a little, though, since every step sends a slight jarring
of pain into your foot.

A dog suddenly trots up next to you. It doesn't seem to be with anyone, but it
looks friendly.

(z_000) Stop and check out its tags.
(z_001) Ignore it and keep moving.

---

z_01

You can't deal with the rock grinding into your heel anymore, so you stop and
take off your shoe so you can dump it out.

Before you get your shoe back on, a dog comes crashing out of the bushes,
yanks your shoe out of your hands, and sprints off.

(z_010) Chase after it, one-shoed.
(z_011) Take off your other shoe and throw it.

---

z_10

You'll save the hill for another day, and double back down Wilkins.

The traffic on Wilkins throws a fine spray of water over you.

(z_100) It's refreshing.
(z_101) It's irritating.

---

z_11

Your breathing deepens as you start getting ready for the hill, and you let
your stride open up a bit so you can hit the base of it and go.

The traffic light turns yellow.

(z_110) You can make it.
(z_111) You slow down.

---

z_000

The dog hops sideways as you reach for its tag; this is a fun game that it's
obviously played before. You catch a glimpse of the wet metal on a bright
green collar, but not much else.

It moves a few steps in the direction you were running anyway, then cocks its
head back at you.

(z_0000) Go for a jog with the dog because it'll be fun.
(z_0001) Go for a jog with the dog and hope for another chance to grab its
collar.

---

z_001

All the dog seems to want is a running buddy, but without your
acknowledgement, it peels away and trots off in the opposite direction.
What a strange omen. What day it it again?


(z_0010) The twenty-fourth.
(z_0011) The thirty-ninth.

---

z_0010

It's hard to keep track of the days sometimes, because all you ever do is run.
Sometimes, you wonder if there's something else you're supposed to do, but
today, you just turn yor face towards the falling raindrops, let yourself
get drenched, and keep running.

(z_00100) Run.
(z_00101) Run.

---

z_0011

That's right, you needed to pick up a package today. You glance at the
steely-grey sky, water droplets stinging your eyes for a moment, as you judge
what time it is. 

(z_00110) Run back the way you came.
(z_00111) Run back the scenic way.

---

z_010

You run awkwardly at an uneven gait, alternating between slapping the
pavement with rubber and sock. The dog runs back the way you came. 

You have no choice but to follow if you want your shoe back.

(z_0100) Sprint harder.
(z_0101) Let the dog go.

---

z_011

You quickly pull off your remaining shoe and sprint a few steps after the
dog, then fling it in the hopes that the dog will be distracted enough to
drop the one it has. Your shoe-jectile smacks the dog soundly on the
rump.

The dog spins around in surprise, then manages to get both shoes into its
mouth and starts trotting towards Wilkins Avenue.

(z_0110) You don't have much more to lose.
(z_0111) Curse at the sky.

---

z_100

You welcome the splash of water over you; you've been drenched since you
stepped out of the house, so it's not a big deal. If anything, it's helping
you stay cool.

A thought occurs to you. What day is it again?

(z_1000) The twenty-fourth. 
(z_1001) The thirty-ninth.

z_1000


It's hard to keep track of the days sometimes, because all you ever do is run.
Sometimes, you wonder if there's something else you're supposed to do, but
today, you just turn yor face towards the falling raindrops, let yourself
get drenched, and keep running.

It feels so good.

(10000) Run.
(10001) Run.

z_1001

That's right, you needed to pick up a package today. You glance at the
steely-grey sky, water droplets stinging your eyes for a moment, as you judge
what time it is. 

(10010) Pick up the pace; you might be late.
(10011) You'll be okay.

---

z_101

It seems like no matter how far from the road you run, the road spray
still reaches you. Times like these make you wish it would stop raining
once in a while. 

You reach Shady Avenue before long, and hang a right since it looks like the
road is a little cleaner.

(z_1010) This is getting aggravating, so you might as well go home.
(z_1011) You're determined to get a good run out of this.

---

z_110

You've got this. Your soggy sneakers dig into the pavement, and you dash
across the street before any of the cars get moving. The hill grows in front
of you, reaching up towards the grey sky.

(z_1100) Push.
(z_1101) Float.

---

z_111

You'd rather not risk hitting the light as it flips over. You become
more aware of the squishing in your socks as you slow to a stop. 

Do you still want to try for the hill?

(z_1110) Yes.
(z_1111) No.

---

z_0100

You splash through puddles after the dog as it waves your shoe at you in a
taunt. It's almost as if the dog is moderating its pace to stay just out of
your reach.

Up ahead, you see a cyclist coming up the sidewalk.

(01000) Yell at the cyclist to grab the dog.
(01001) Don't bother them; this is your problem.

---

z_0101

It's hopeless; that dog is way faster than you, especially with only one shoe.
You slow to a walk and let the dog peel off, and resign yourself to trudging
home.

As you reach Shady Avenue, you're almost clipped by a courier flying by.

(01010) Jokingly ask for a ride.
(01011) Yell something rude.

---

z_1010

You're done with this, so you slog your soggy self back towards home.
You've got other things to get to today, anyway.

(10100) Like meeting a courier for a package delivery.
(10101) Like taking a long hot shower and finding dry clothes.

---

z_1011

Despite everything, you maintain steady resolve to push through and keep
running. 

As you cross Shady Avenue, you're almost clipped by a courier flying by.

(10110) Jokingly ask for a ride.
(10111) Yell something rude.

---

z_0000

The dog makes a decent running buddy, and it keeps perfect pace with you.
You're breathing in sync, striding in sync, moving across the pavement
as if you had always run together.

When you reach South Negley Avenue, the dog wants to turn left.

(00000) Turn right.
(00001) Turn left.

---

z_0001

You pretend to slip into pace next to the dog, waiting for it to settle
down a little. Once the dog seems content to trot along next to you, you
snatch at its collar again. 

The tag reads "ROLLER", and a phonne number in the 412 area code.

(00010) Tell Roller to sit.
(00011) Keep running and look for someone with a phone.

---

z_0110

You can't help but laugh at yourself a little, because you're shoeless
in the middle of the street in a rain storm and some dog managed to outsmart
you. 

Might as well cut your losses and head home.

(01100) At least the clouds look like they might clear up.
(01101) Enjoy stepping through some mud puddles on your way.

---

z_0111

What horrible luck; you raise your fist to the sky as if it was the fault of
the clouds. They only respond by pouring more rain onto you. The dog is
already nowhere to be seen.

Might as well cut your losses and head home.

(01110) Take off your soggy socks first.
(01111) Slosh through every puddle on the way.

---

z_1100

The hill is a part of the earth and you are a plow driving through it. You
keep your head low and your shoulders curled, and every step presses
down into the pavement.

(11000) You were made for this.
(11001) You've worked hard for this.

---

z_1101

The hill is a protrustion into the sky, and the more you run, the closer to
the clouds you rise. You tilt your chin up to meet the rain, and your body
grows lighter.

(11010) You were made for this.
(11011) You've worked hard for this.

---

z_1110

You wait for the light to turn to your favor again, and bolt out into the
street as soon as it changes. The hill rises ahead of you.

(11100) Take a deep breath.
(11101) Take a good look.

---

z_1111

You've lost your mojo, so you jog in place at the intersection while
working out your next movee.

A courier blasts through the intersection and splashes muddy rainwater
all over you.

(11110) You're already drenched anyway.
(11111) That's the last straw.
