It's the thirty-ninth day of the rainy season.

Right now,

"I lost my dog," a woman said to a passing cyclist, who seemed intent to
ignore her at first. "Have you seen Roller?"

The cyclist, impatient with a delivery job, only gave her a helpless shrug.  

Roller had escaped not too long ago, and made friends with a quiet jogger a
few streets over. The jogger led him unknowingly towards the meeting between
the woman and the cyclist.

The four converged.

"Hey!" a woman shouted at a passing cyclist, who blew by without a care.
All she wanted was an extra set of eyes to look for her dog.

The dog's name was Roller, and he had escaped not too long ago and made
friends with a quiet jogger a few streets over. The jogger was willing to
follow the dog wherever he went. 

After a few blocks of running together, Roller left his running
buddy and went off to find another.

In the following days, the woman put up 'MISSING DOG' signs all over the
neighborhoood.

"His name is Roller," a woman said to a kind cyclist who stopped to help.
"He broke off his leash and took off."

"How long ago was this?" the cyclist asked, while dismounting. 

It wasn't too long ago, and Roller had in fact met a jogger a few
streets over. "Sit!" the jogger said optimistically, while trying to
figure out how to return him to his owner.

Roller wasn't very good at following directions, or he just had his own
plans for his day. Suspecting the jogger of unkind intentions, he
danced across the street, through some bushes, and disappeared into the
neighborhood.

All she wanted was an extra set of eyes to look for her dog.

The dog's name was Roller, and he had escaped not too long ago and made
friends with a quiet jogger a few streets over. They continued running
together while the jogger hoped to pass someone who might have a phone.

Before long, though, Roller and the jogger ended up back where the woman
was standing around ineffectually. The three of them converged.
